- TODO: public update methods should deal with multiple levels of changes with (HashMap<String, Object) as parameter, especially with common interface
- TODO: User has protected account object
	- Account is created in constructor before User.create method, with proper try-catch to abort user creation in case of failure
	- Account is retrieved, updated and deleted inside User.retrieve method (?)
	- Account is interacted with publicly through a "getAccount" method: this way account cannot be set externally, but only its methods can be used
		- Alternatively, hold the account through an "AccountInterface" so that it's safer?
- TODO: by holding the user in the session there needs to be means of synchronisation between devices; can "all sessions" be checked in wildfly?
- TODO: consider having a different storage object for calendars



!TODO: in the future, the data could be <String, Object> and the methods use PreparedStatement.setObject
