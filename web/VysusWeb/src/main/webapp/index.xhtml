	<p>
		VYSUS is not just a system for supply teachers: VYSUS offers high-quality staff for schools that meet all 
		the requirements the school has set using a unique algorithm. Schools can easily sign-up and start 
		recruiting their supply teacher by creating a job advert, then responding to a few key question and finally 
		a ranking of potential supply teachers will be generated based on relevant academic and professional 
		experience. But VYUSUS does not end at this stage. We aim to provide a unique experience that will facilitate 
		the recruitment by for example supplying a messaging system for easy interactions between potential recruits 
		and schools. We are looking for potential improvement and the implementation of additional features and 
		together we hope to be able to help.
